\label{sec:use_cases}
\subsection{UC1 Covid Tracker}
If a healthy person is within a defined range of an infected person for a defined time, the healthy person is notified and counted as an infected person from then onwards. To accomplish this, every person carries an UWB-Kit, which tracks his distance with TWR to other UWB-Kits and exchanges the infection state with them. 

\subsection{UC2 Hotel Door}
If a person comes close to a hotel door from the outside with the appropriate key, the door is unlocked and the person can enter the hotel room. As soon as the person with the key is inside the room, the door is locked again. The person can leave the room by mechanically unlocking the door. For every hotel room there is only one key containing one UWB-Kit, whereas the door-with-lock holds multiple UWB-Kits to determine the relative position of the key. This is accomplished with the use of TWR and TDoA. 

\subsection{UC3 (optional) Car Door}
If a person approaches a car with the appropriate car-key, the car only opens when the key comes from a defined direction. Therefore, the car-key consists of one UWB-Kit, while the car comprises multiple UWB-Kits. This allows the car to determine the relative position of the car-key using TDoA.
