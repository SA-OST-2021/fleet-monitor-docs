\label{sec:use_cases}
\subsection{UC1 Driving Quality Analysis}
Having a clear understanding of a drivers behavior, is very important for fleet operators. Having data about the vehicle operators can lead to less emissions, improve customer satisfaction and improve the drivers behavior. Our system can be deployed to gather driving data.  

\subsection{UC2 Vehicle Maintenance Report}
Managing a large fleet of vehicles requires enormous effort. In order to minimize down time it is important to preemptively warn about upcoming and present issues. Our system makes it possible gather continuous information about the status of the fleet without physical access. 

\subsection{UC3 (optional) Modeling of Motion Behavior}
