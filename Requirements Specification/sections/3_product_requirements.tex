\subsection{Hardware}
The on purpose build, custom hardware contains all necessary components integrated on a single printed circuit board (PCB).
The core is based on a micro controller of the ESP32-Family. 



\subsection{Firmware}
For all use cases defined in \cref{sec:use_cases}, 

\subsection{Web Server Communication Tool}
The web server communication tool is the sole device communicating with the hardware. The system has the following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
        \item The web server shall be written in Python.
        \item The system shall handle http request to achieve a good communication between the embedded system and the host.
        \item The system shall store the streamed data and make it available for further processing.
        \item The system should host files for the hardware (e.g. configuration files, firmware updates).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Interpreter and Visualizer}
This Python-based tool consists of two separated parts and follows the subsequent requirements:

\begin{itemize}
		\item The Data Interpreter shall parse FMS-Packages and prepares them for further usage.
		\item The Data Visualizer shall use a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in order to present the FMS data (e.g. parameter values).
\end{itemize}
