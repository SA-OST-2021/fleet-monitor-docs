\section{Task Definition}
To collect vehicle data of the Fleet Management System (FMS) and provide IP-based access, a dedicated device has to be developed. It acts as a gateway (communication bridge) and connects the internal CAN-Bus to an Ethernet interface (LAN and wireless should be supported).


A general block diagram of the system is shown in \cref{fig:constellation_HW}.

FMS-Packages are received by the gateway and then get redirected to a local server application, running on the vehicles on-board network router.
Further, the information can be transmitted over the internet to a cloud-based system.
